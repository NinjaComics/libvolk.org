      VOLK is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. It is a library that contains
      kernels of hand-written SIMD code for different mathematical operations. Since
      each SIMD architecture can be very different and no compiler has yet come along
      to handle vectorization properly or highly efficiently, VOLK approaches the
      problem differently.
      </p>
      <p>
      For each architecture or platform that a developer wishes to vectorize for, a
      new proto-kernel is added to VOLK. At runtime, VOLK will select the correct
      proto-kernel. In this way, the users of VOLK call a kernel for performing the
      operation that is platform/architecture agnostic. This allows us to write
      portable SIMD code.
